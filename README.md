# Self-organised-criticality-in-Oslo-Model

Implemented the Oslo model which is a simulation of a sand pile. Numerically and theoretically investigated the height distributions and avalanche-size probabilities for each system size. Performed data collapses for the heights and the avalanche-sizes. Discovered that the sand pile avalanches follow a power law distribution which means an avalanche spanning 12 orders of magnitude can occur from the addition of one grain.

# Testing the sand pile works (task1.py)

Five checks to ensure model of sand pile is functioning as expected.

# Height distributions (task2a.py)

Measure total height of pile as function of time:

# Logarithmic and rescaled height distributions, and Data collapse I (task2c.py - task2b.py was a written excersise)

Plot height distributions for different size sand piles logarithmically and rescale each system by its length and size.
